* Marvell MMP Interrupt controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "mrvl,mmp-intc", "mrvl,mmp2-intc" or
  "mrvl,mmp2-mux-intc", "mrvl,mmp-intc-wakeupgen"
- reg : Address and length of the register set of the interrupt controller.
  If the interrupt controller is intc, address and length means the range
  of the whold interrupt controller. If the interrupt controller is mux-intc,
  address and length means one register. Since address of mux-intc is in the
  range of intc. mux-intc is secondary interrupt controller.
- reg-names : Name of the register set of the interrupt controller. It's
  only required in mux-intc interrupt controller.
- interrupts : Should be the port interrupt shared by mux interrupts. It's
  only required in mux-intc interrupt controller.
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source.
- mrvl,intc-gbl-mask : Specifies the address and value for global mask in the
  interrupt controller.
- mrvl,intc-for-cp : Specifies the irqs that will be routed to cp
- mrvl,intc-nr-irqs : Specifies the number of interrupts in the interrupt
  controller.
- mrvl,clr-mfp-irq : Specifies the interrupt that needs to clear MFP edge
  detection first.
- mrvl,inct-wake-clr: Specifies the device interrupt and mask bits that needs
  to be cleared in ISR. Here the device refers to SD, Keypad etc, if system is
  wake up by it, MMP DE added some logic in PMU to assert a signal to interrupt
  controller, and we have to write APMU_WAKE_CLR register related bit to deassert
  this signal which keeps triggering interrupt.Itâ€™s due to SD card insert/remove
  or keypad press may need some time to be detected (debounce time), and DE want
  to avoid to enter LPM again to lose this event.

Example:
	intc: interrupt-controller@d4282000 {
		compatible = "mrvl,mmp2-intc";
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0xd4282000 0x1000>;
		mrvl,intc-nr-irqs = <64>;
	};

	intcmux4@d4282150 {
		compatible = "mrvl,mmp2-mux-intc";
		interrupts = <4>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x150 0x4>, <0x168 0x4>;
		reg-names = "mux status", "mux mask";
		mrvl,intc-nr-irqs = <2>;
	};

	intc: interrupt-controller@d4282000 {
		compatible = "mrvl,mmp-intc";
		reg = <0xd4282000 0x1000>;
		mrvl,intc-wakeup = <0x114 0x3
		                    0x144 0x3>;
	};

* Marvell Orion Interrupt controller

Required properties
- compatible :  Should be "marvell,orion-intc".
- #interrupt-cells: Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. Supported value is <1>.
- interrupt-controller : Declare this node to be an interrupt controller.
- reg : Interrupt mask address. A list of 4 byte ranges, one per controller.
        One entry in the list represents 32 interrupts.

Example:

	intc: interrupt-controller {
        	compatible = "marvell,orion-intc", "marvell,intc";
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
                reg = <0xfed20204 0x04>,
		      <0xfed20214 0x04>;
        };
